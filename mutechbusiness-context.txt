📄 Mutech Business – MVP Context (Cursor Master Context)

Project Purpose

Build the MVP website for Mutech Business, a consulting firm focused on helping entrepreneurs and small businesses start correctly by avoiding poor early decisions in structure, platforms, and positioning.

This is not a mass-market product.
This is not a conversion-optimized funnel.

Primary Objective:
Receive few but highly qualified applications from clients who value structure, clarity, and boundaries.

Success Metric:
Low volume, high-quality applications that align with Mutech’s way of thinking.

🧠 Core Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

Mutech Business does not sell:

websites

automation

branding for aesthetics

motivation or hype

Mutech Business sells:

structured thinking

decision clarity

prevention of early irreversible mistakes

The website must communicate how we think, not just what we do.

🗣 Tone & Voice (Strict Rules)

DO

Clear

Calm

Firm

Honest

Slightly challenging

DO NOT

Use motivational language

Use empty startup phrases

Promise success or results

Sound “friendly-salesy”

Use hype or exaggerated claims

Mindset:
“This is how we work. If it doesn’t fit you, that’s okay.”

🧱 Key Messages (Used as Filters)

These ideas must be clearly communicated (not necessarily as slogans):

“We don’t help you execute ideas. We help you not start wrong.”

“Most businesses fail due to small decisions made early.”

“This package provides a clear foundation, not guaranteed success.”

“If you are looking for something fast and cheap, this service is not for you.”

If a visitor feels uncomfortable reading this, that is intended.

📝 Application Form (Critical UX Rule)

This is NOT a contact form.

It is an application designed to:

slow the user down

force reflection

self-qualify the applicant

Fields:

Business type

City / location

Current state (what already exists)

Main pain point

Desired outcome

Urgency level

No extra fields.
No “friendly” copy.
No instant gratification language.

🧩 Site Structure (MVP Only)

The MVP website includes ONLY:

Home

Clear positioning

Philosophy-first hero

Who this is / isn’t for

CTA → Apply

Kickstarter Package

What is included

What is explicitly NOT included

Clear boundaries

No upsell language

Apply

Application form only

❌ No chatbot
❌ No dashboards
❌ No payments
❌ No automation explanations

🎨 Visual Direction

Minimal

Clean

Structured

High whitespace

Strong hierarchy

No trendy animations

No “happy startup” visuals

Design should feel controlled, not playful.

⚙ Technical Direction (Secondary)

Technology exists to serve clarity, not impress.

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Custom CSS (no generic Tailwind look)

Animations: Minimal or none

Focus: Readability and intent

✅ Definition of “Done”

The MVP is successful if a visitor finishes reading and thinks:

“These people think differently.
If I work with them, I won’t be improvising.”
